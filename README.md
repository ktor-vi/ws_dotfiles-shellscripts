# Dotfiles and shell scripts workshop

## UNIX-like systems

Linux distros and MacOS are Unix-like (\*nix systems), they follow the basic principles formalised by the AT&T UNIX operating system.

With no doubt (and completely subjectively) \*nix OSes are the best, and i'll show *some* cool stuff about it
(CLI's, Dotfiles, Scripting, heck maybe even vim!)

## What is a dotfile and how to use them ?

Dotfiles, typically .bashrc are used to store configuration files about your IDE, Text editor, Terminal, etc

The problem is migrating these configs around several machines can be annoying and time-consuming, so i will show how to save them and retrieve them from *the internet*.

## What is a shell script ?
A shell script is a program designed to be run be a unix command-line interpreter (Your Terminal)

Your scripts will have to work accordingly to your Terminal --> 

```
#!/bin/bash
```

Before your .sh script

## Goal of the workshop : 

Save your configurations with a git bare repository and use shell scripts to fool around!

### Some more fun with shell scripts : 

1.Hello world
2.User input
3.Make directory
4.Send email
5.Some evil stuff you can think of

#### ... You decide about the rest
